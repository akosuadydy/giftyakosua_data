exploring, and visualizing datasets. This module focused on understanding different types of data, 
using analytical tools, and preparing data for analysis.

Key Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the characteristics of data and datasets
2. Explore different types of data: structured, unstructured, static, and streaming
3. Learn how to use tools like Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Tableau
4. Get started with Kaggle to access public datasets
